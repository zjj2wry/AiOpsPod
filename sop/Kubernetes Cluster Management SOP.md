Title: Kubernetes Cluster Management SOP

Objective: To provide guidelines and best practices for managing Kubernetes clusters in a production environment.

1. Cluster Setup and Configuration:
- Follow the official Kubernetes documentation for setting up a new cluster.
- Use a configuration management tool like Ansible or Terraform for automating cluster setup.
- Ensure proper network configuration, security settings, and resource allocation.

2. Cluster Monitoring and Logging:
- Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring cluster health and performance.
- Set up centralized logging using tools like Elasticsearch and Kibana for tracking cluster events and troubleshooting issues.

3. Cluster Security:
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict access to cluster resources.
- Enable network policies to control traffic flow within the cluster.
- Regularly update Kubernetes components and apply security patches.

This SOP document should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in Kubernetes best practices and new features. It should also be shared with all team members responsible for managing Kubernetes clusters to ensure consistency and adherence to guidelines.
