Title: Prometheus Monitoring SOP

Objective: To provide guidelines and best practices for setting up and using Prometheus for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.

1. Prometheus Setup and Configuration:
- Follow the official Prometheus documentation for setting up a new Prometheus server.
- Install Prometheus using Helm charts for easier deployment and management.
- Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Kubernetes nodes, pods, and services.

2. Alerting and Notification:
- Set up alerting rules in Prometheus to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- Configure alertmanager to send notifications via email, Slack, or other channels.
- Test alerting and notification configurations to ensure timely response to critical issues.

3. Grafana Integration:
- Install Grafana for visualizing Prometheus metrics and creating dashboards.
- Import pre-built Grafana dashboards for monitoring Kubernetes cluster health and performance.
- Customize Grafana dashboards to display relevant metrics for your specific use case.

4. Data Retention and Storage:
- Configure Prometheus retention policies to manage storage space and retention of metrics data.
- Set up remote storage options like Thanos or Cortex for long-term storage and scalability.
- Regularly monitor storage usage and adjust retention policies as needed.

5. Prometheus Best Practices:
- Use labels and annotations effectively to organize and query metrics in Prometheus.
- Monitor Prometheus server performance and resource utilization to ensure optimal operation.
- Regularly update Prometheus and related components to apply security patches and new features.

6. Troubleshooting and Maintenance:
- Use Prometheus query language (PromQL) for troubleshooting metric queries and debugging issues.
- Monitor Prometheus alerts and notifications to identify and resolve monitoring gaps.
- Perform regular maintenance tasks like cleaning up old data and optimizing Prometheus configuration.

This SOP document should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in Prometheus best practices and new features. It should also be shared with all team members responsible for monitoring Kubernetes clusters to ensure effective monitoring and alerting.
