Title: Prometheus Monitoring SOP

Objective: To provide guidelines and best practices for setting up and using Prometheus for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.

1. Prometheus Setup and Configuration:
- Follow the official Prometheus documentation for setting up a new Prometheus server.
- Install Prometheus using Helm charts for easier deployment and management.
- Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Kubernetes nodes, pods, and services.

2. Alerting and Notification:
- Set up alerting rules in Prometheus to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- Configure alertmanager to send notifications via email, Slack, or other channels.
- Test alerting and notification configurations to ensure timely response to critical issues.

3. Grafana Integration:
- Install Grafana for visualizing Prometheus metrics and creating dashboards.
- Import pre-built Grafana dashboards for monitoring Kubernetes cluster health and performance.
- Customize Grafana dashboards to display relevant metrics for your specific use case.

This SOP document should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in Prometheus best practices and new features. It should also be shared with all team members responsible for monitoring Kubernetes clusters to ensure effective monitoring and alerting.
